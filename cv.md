## About Me

I always had a dream of being a programmer, I knew that this requires a lot of skills. And for me to be a programmer is the desire and passion to learn new information, to be in search of adventures, to feel the need for new discoveries. This is a fresh sphere where you can be a pioneer like Christopher Columbus or Vasco da Gama. Finding new ways to make life easier give people new opportunities. For everything else, studying has always been easy for me, at a university college or school.
